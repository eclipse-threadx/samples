# Azure RTOS - Additional samples

This repository hosts additional samples for Azure RTOS v6.2.0. For samples based previous releases, you can find them in the [v6.1 branch](https://github.com/azure-rtos/samples/tree/v6.1).

## Embedded IDE samples

You can find Embedded IDE (IAR Workbench and semi's IDE) sample projects in addition to the content in the [Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/azure-rtos/getting-started). Each board-specific sample project contains a series of projects that cover Azure RTOS components (ThreadX, NetX Duo, GUIX, FileX and USBX) as well as samples for connecting to [Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/), and enable OTA for the device using [Device Update for IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub-device-update/) service. Detailed guide is inlcuded in the file of each devkit.
